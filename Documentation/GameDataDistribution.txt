Game progression is linear like ff7/fft/or any jrpg

Scene Ordering Ideas for the main story
	- The entire storyline should be broken up into blocks 
	- Each block should be broken into checkpoints (like skyrim quests)
		- Block: 1, sections 1,2,3,4,5...
	- Each block needs dialogue, a setting, setting boundaries (where the player can walk), control boundaries (what the player can do)
	- Every moment in the game should be contained in one of these blocks.
		- enforce what is available based on the main story, even when 
	- Unlock sequentially: once a block is complete, the next block opens
	- Need an object to track which part of the game the player is currently on
	
Side Quests
	- separate block of storyline that has no impact on the main storyline boundaries
	- unlock side quests like an event 
	
Event elements
	- events in the game are some task that needs to be saved. some examples are:
		- Opening treasure chests
		- starting quests
		- unlocking doors or new area boundaries
		- tracking character conversations
		- any action that needs to have its state maintained through the duration of the game.

Elements that need to be saved
	- Character states and info: levels, stats, ...
	- main story storyline block
	- Side quest blocks
	- global events
